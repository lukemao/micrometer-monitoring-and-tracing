# micrometer-monitoring-and-tracing

This repository uses simple examples to illustrate how to build a microservice monitoring and API tracing system using Grafana|Prometheus|Zipkin

I use two example applications to demonstrate this solution. I use them to demo instrumentation provided by Spring Actuator(Prometheus) and Spring Sleuth(Zipkin)

Note that the Demo project is borrowes from AmigoCode.

I have provided config yml files for configuring Prometheus and its Alert Manager.

To install Prometheus and Alert Manage please follow this:

Alert Manager:
